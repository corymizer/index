                    <h3>Cleveland SC Partners with Admiral Sports as Official Kit Provider</h3>
                    <h4>April 14th, 2018</h4>
                    <p>Cleveland SC Partners with Admiral Sports as Official Kit Provider

                        CLEVELAND, OH- Cleveland SC is proud to announce an exclusive multi-year partnership agreement with Admiral Sports to supply the club’s team wear and merchandise.<br><br>

                        Under the agreement, Admiral becomes the club’s official sportswear provider including team wear and staff wear.<br><br>

                        Cleveland SC will begin their inaugural season in the National Premier Soccer League’s (NPSL) Midwest East Conference in 2018. The club was founded in February 2018 by club President Sam Seibert, who is a resident of Lakewood, OH.<br><br>

                        “Admiral Sports has a track record of producing world-class kits for prestigious clubs around the world. Cleveland SC is excited to join this group of legendary clubs to don Admiral sportswear while representing their communities,” said Seibert.<br><br>

                        “We’re delighted to have been chosen to supply Cleveland SC.  Admiral has a long history of supplying professional and youth soccer in Cleveland.  We worked with the Cleveland Force back in the 80’s, so it’s great to once again be creating unique sportswear for soccer players and fans in the city.  We’re making the club totally unique, custom and affordable merchandise that the players and fans will love to wear,” said Paul Hamburger, CEO and Owner of Admiral Sports.<br><br>

                        “It is important for our club to have kits that players and fans alike will be proud to wear on the field, in the stands and throughout all the great communities of Northeast Ohio. Cleveland SC’s goal is to not just be visible on weekends at Don Shula Stadium, but also be a lifestyle presence in all corners of our city. Admiral Sports was the clear choice to help us grow in the years to come,” said Seibert.<br><br>

                        Admiral is a legendary brand, having been worn by some of the biggest names in the sporting world.  The England National Team, Manchester United, and the New York Cosmos are just some of the clubs that once donned Admiral. In fact, Admiral has supplied most of the current EPL teams in addition to being the largest brand in the original NASL. The company, a pioneering brand in the truest sense, was recently the subject of an ITV documentary called Get Shirty.<br><br>

                        Admiral has now grown into a major player in the North American team wear market. The company also offers a wide range of accessories, including goals, bags, balls, goalkeeper gloves, referee supplies, and training equipment.<br><br>

                        The NPSL is the largest established men’s soccer league in the United States with 96 teams competing across the country in 2017.  The NPSL is a successor to the Men’s Premier Soccer League (MPSL), which was formed in 2002.  The NPSL is a member league of the United States Adult Soccer Association (USASA) and sanctioned by U.S. Soccer, the governing body of soccer in all its forms in the United States.  The NPSL’s cooperative and turnkey ownership platform has led to its explosive growth, countless player development opportunities, and commitment to grow the game in the United States.<br><br>
