            <p>Cleveland SC has several internships for students who are interested in the sports and entertainment industry. As an intern, you will have the opportunity to learn how matchday operations flow, and you will also be involved behind the scenes with the staff presenting Cleveland SC in the brightest of lights. Internships require participation at all home matches, and some internships may also provide opportunities to travel with the team to away matches. Cleveland SC provides college credit for students who successfully complete their internship program.<br><br>

            Volunteers are also an integral part of the matchday experience at Don Schula Stadium. From manning the concessions and merchandise stands, to ensuring the teams and referees are properly accommodated, we need your support to present the best atmosphere possible for your fellow fans!<br><br>
